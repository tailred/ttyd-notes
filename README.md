## Chapter 3
Go inside the lower lobby doors
Sign up to be a fighter
 
For the 5 fights you use fright masks on, you only have 1 extra. Do not waste your extra unless it is absolutely necessary. You need 1 star point from these battles to not be over-leveled, but it is ok to normally kill 2-3 enemies.

**Notes**
● Jumping while waiting for the Guards delays him from entering the room. Try to avoid doing any actions during this time aside from equipping badges/changing partners.
● The fastest way to end a non-attack turn is to swap partners.
● The fastest way to fulfill "use at least one Special Move" is to fail an Earth Tremor. If you do this, it may be a good idea to appeal on turns where you can't attack, or to use stylish moves to refill your Star Power in case this condition comes up again.
● Jumping on spiky enemies DOES count towards "take damage at least 5 times." Swapping to Goombella might be a good idea before these fights.
● Superguarding DOES NOT count as an attack in the event of "don't attack for the first three turns."
● If you get "don't attack for the first three turns" on any fight, running away DOES NOT fail the condition.
● If you're overleveled already and you get "don't use items" on a fight where you'd normally use a Fright Mask, you can run from the fight and get a new condition. This wastes about a minute, so it's not recommended unless necessary.
● If you're ever running from a fight for a different reason, make sure that you fulfill the condition BEFORE running away, or else you will drop a rank and need to refight your last opponents.
● It's not too common, but the fight order can vary.
